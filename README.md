# Analyze NFL Picks With R
Update the csv with your picks and spreads(if different than default csv), and run the R code to get some basic graphs and stats.

## Files
Plot.R to see a graph of success over time

Describe.R to get a detailed breakdown of frequency and success by pick type

TestMath.R to verify your records make sense and formulas are correct

## Coming soon
- Success by spread size clusters
- More visualization of results via plots and reports
- Possible Shiny web app
- Possible ML with caret for prediction
